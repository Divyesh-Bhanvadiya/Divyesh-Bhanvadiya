# 👋 Hi, I'm Divyesh

💻 **3rd Year Computer Programming & Analysis Student @ Seneca College**  
Building cool stuff and exploring full-stack dev, cybersecurity (+ home-labbing 🔐), and game development 🎮

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

Currently developing a **NextJS website for a client** - check it out [here](https://www.sieshapar.com)!

Most of my recent work lives in private repositories as I experiment with different tech stacks and build production-ready projects. My contribution graph shows I'm actively coding - just organizing and documenting things before making them public.

In the meantime, you can check out some coursework here that shows my fundamentals.
